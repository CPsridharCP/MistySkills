	FPS_IDFinger.ino - Library example for controlling the GT-511C3 Finger Print Scanner (FPS)
	Created by Josh Hawley, July 23rd 2013
	Licensed for non-commercial use, must include this license message
	basically, Feel free to hack away at it, but just give me credit for my work =)
	TLDR; Wil Wheaton's Law

	Description: This sketch will attempt to identify a previously enrolled fingerprint
	saved in its database.
	
	This code should work with the any model of ADH-Tech's FPS as long as
	you are within the minimum logic level threshold for the FPS serial UART.
	This code has been tested with these models:

              GT-521F52 [ https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14585 ]
              GT-521F32 [ https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14518 ]
              GT-511C3  [ https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11792 ]
              GT-511C1R [ https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13007 ]

-------------------- HARDWARE HOOKUP with 5V Arduino --------------------
1.) Dedicated Bi-Directional Logic Level Converter (LLC)
It is recommended to use a dedicated bi-direcitonal LLC
[ https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12009 ] for a reliable connection if you
are using a 5V Arduino microcontroller:
   Fingerprint Scanner (Pin #) <-> Logic Level Converter <-> 5V Arduino w/ Atmega328P
     UART_TX (3.3V TTL)(Pin 1) <->     LV1 <-> HV1       <->  RX (pin 4)
     UART_RX (3.3V TTL)(Pin 2) <->     LV4 <-> HV4       <->  TX (pin 5)
           GND         (Pin 3) <->     GND <-> GND       <->     GND
      Vin (3.3V~6V)    (Pin 4) <->        HV             <->      5V
                                          LV             <->     3.3V
					  
2.) Voltage Division w/ 3x 10kOhm Resistors
Otherwise, you could use 3x 10kOhm resistors [ https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11508 ]
to divide the voltage from a 5V Arduino down to 3.3V FPS similar to the
"Uni-Directional" application circuit on our old logic level converter
[ https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/b/0/e/1/0/522637c6757b7f2b228b4568.png ]:
    Voltage Divider         <-> Fingerprint Scanner(Pin #) <-> Voltage Divider <-> 5V Arduino w/ Atmega328P
                            <-> UART_TX (3.3V TTL) (Pin 1) <->                 <->       RX (pin 4)
  GND <-> 10kOhm <-> 10kOhm <-> UART_RX (3.3V TTL) (Pin 2) <->      10kOhm     <->       TX (pin 5)
          GND               <->        GND         (Pin 3) <->       GND       <->        GND
                            <->    Vin (3.3V~6V)   (Pin 4) <->                 <->        5V
			    
Note: You can add the two 10kOhm resistors in series for 20kOhms. =)
