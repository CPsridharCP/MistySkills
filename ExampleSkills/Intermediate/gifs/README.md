## Playing GIFs

#### A simple workaround to play GIFs as part of a skill until it is supported

##### Only until Misty supports playing GIFs
##### Needs a little bit of pre-work but works :) 

##### Step 1 : Go to http://gifgifs.com/split/
##### Step 2 : Upload you git and then click Extract Frames
##### Step 3 : Click Download all frames as .ZIP archive
##### Step 4 : Delete all the files in the frames folder found in this repo
##### Step 5 : Unzip the file downloaded from Step4 and copy paste the images into our frames folder
##### Step 6 : Change the start and end variables here in the code to match the number of frames downloaded on your GIF
##### Step 7 : If you also have filenames prefixes of postfixed with someText, you could add that in the function call as well. 
##### Step 8 : Drag Drop or upload the gifs.js, gifs.json, and the frames folder using Misty's skill ruinner http://sdk.mistyrobotics.com/skill-runner/index.html
