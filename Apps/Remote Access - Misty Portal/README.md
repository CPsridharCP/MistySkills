Get a global IP for Misty in less than 5 mins. The app uses Ngrok on the backend.

This app runs on a computer that is on the same network as Misty. Pick the executables from this repo based on your OS. Works on Linux, Mac and Windows. Installation instructions are contained inside each directory.

### Steps:
1. Enter Misty's local IP address
2. Copy Paste your NGROK auth token (click help on the UI for links)
3. Select usage : nomal / adb
4. Click Open Portal

DONE!

Now you will get a new IP for Misty that you can share with anyone on the Internet. 
This IP can be used in command center, api exlorer, skillrunner, JS and C# SDK, all apps that Misty interfaces with except that this time the user does not need to be on the same network.
